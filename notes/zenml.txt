zenml notes:

- to locate thee repository in the project, use 'zenml init'
- projects are for paid users only, so lets keep all in the default project
- to open the UI, use 'zenml login --local --blocking'
    - be careful, sometimes the UI shows other servers. you can see available servers with 'zenml server list'
    - close with ctrl+c, check closed with 'zenml status'
