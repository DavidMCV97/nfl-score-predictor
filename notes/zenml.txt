zenml notes:

- to create the local repository .zen, use 'zenml init'
- projects are for paid users only, so lets keep all in the default project
- to open the UI, use 'zenml login --local --blocking'
    - be careful, sometimes the UI shows other servers. you can see available servers with 'zenml server list'
    - close with ctrl+c, check closed with 'zenml status'
-'zenml stack describe' lets you find out details about your active stack.
    - Artifact Store: Is where the artifacts are saved (trained models, processed data, metrics, logs, etc.)
    - Orchestrator: Defines entity who will execute and manage code (Airflow, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, Azure ML, etc)
