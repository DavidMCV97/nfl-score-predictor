# NFL Score Predictor project

A comprehensive machine learning operations (MLOps) project for predicting National Football League (NFL) match outcomes using historical data and advanced feature engineering.

## 🎯 **Targets**
- Develop a simple use tool for predicting NFL game outcomes (win/lose) with asociated probability.
- Implement a professional MLOps pipeline and good programming practices.
- Overcome the benchmark of 54% of precision for NFL prediction algorithms.
